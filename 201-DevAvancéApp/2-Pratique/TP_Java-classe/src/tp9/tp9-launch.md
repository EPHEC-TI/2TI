# How to launch TP9 Project

## Serveur and Client
Simply launch firstly Serveur and afterwards Client.

## Chat and ChatConsole
In order to launch Chat and ChatConsole, there something a little bit tricky.

On Eclipse, click on **Run Configurations...** (it's under _Run_ options).

In the open window, under _Arguments_, in _Program arguments_, launch it once with _**true**_ argument and an other time with _**false**_ argument.

The project should now launch correctly in the _Console_ window.
Please note that there's a bug with the color used between the client and server text in the chat.
