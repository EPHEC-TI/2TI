### Communication in IT
The communication is very important. IT Work is also a social and politic work.
Not everyone can speaks and understand the "IT" language. People needs to understand what's your job and what you're doing.

## Mission statement of a company

### Mission statement or not mission statement 
Dunno bruh, it depends on how you write it :

But if you have a mission statement :
- It does give a direction to the company
